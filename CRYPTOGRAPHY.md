## Digital Signature
- The signature of an enclave characterizes the content and the layout of the enclave at build time. 
- If the enclaveâ€™s content and layout are not correct per the signature, then the enclave will fail to be initialized
- If an enclave is initialized, it should be identical to the original enclave and will not be modified at runtime
